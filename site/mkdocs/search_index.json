We are developing a completely new banking experience by dissolving all the barriers of archaic banks such as the need to come to a branch, doing endless paperwork, dealing with hard-to-use, buggy mobile apps, and protecting data with hard-to-remember, complex passwords.\nWe have created a safe, strong financial tool, specifically designed to be used by people who are undereducated or who don\u2019t possess identification.
