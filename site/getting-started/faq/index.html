<h2 id="does-your-business-model-include-any-banking-services-for-example-p2p-loans-made-in-hmq">Does your business model include any banking services (for example P2P loans made in HMQ)?</h2>
<p><strong>Or is the Humaniq business model  purely the cryptocurrency and any other fintech activities will be provided by fintech startups using the HMQ currency? So finally are the owners of HMQ currency going to be able to lend money to other owners of HMQ for an interest thru the platform or will those kind of services only be executed  by companies instead of private users?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to have almost any fintech service imaginable, including P2P and loan services. But at the beginning we will only provide infrastructure for financial services and verification of transactions. We’re sponsoring other startups who have services that will plug in, as well as working on partnerships with established services who are interested in participating.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-any-plans-to-offer-custom-humaniq-phones">Do you have any plans to offer custom Humaniq phones?</h2>
<p>We’ve received some offers, but currently we do not have plans for production of a branded smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="how-effective-are-banks-at-expanding-their-reach-into-unbanked-populations">How effective are banks at expanding their reach into unbanked populations?</h2>
<p>Banks are not efficient, because they don’t want to service low-margin customers. Unbanked people can not afford normal banking services. At the same time for banks it is quite expensive to invest in infrastructure in these regions. In general the daily budget for such people is approximately 1-3 USD per day and their deposits normally do not exceed 50 USD. Also the majority of payment systems have minimum account balance thresholds  and minimum deposit sums.</p>
<h2 id="is-money-supply-enough-for-everyone">Is money supply enough for everyone?</h2>
<p><strong>Another point about the money supply of cryptocurrencies is that it’s too small for many countries. Bitcoin is good except for its float limitation. It encourages people to hoard and save it as a store of wealth. Per your whitepaper is the absolute float limited? Or can it increase by 500 with each new user? Hence its ultimate limit is the number of users. In section 6 you  discuss an absolute limitation. Do you think that's wise and necessary? E.g. central banks increase money supply when conditions warrant. Why does that flexibility not apply here?</strong></p>
<p>After the critical mass is reached, we expect the system will develop by its own, which does not mean we stop our marketing campaigns. And of course money supply limits are aimed at increasing capitalization and interest in terms of keeping funds inside the system. If you continually print money you run the risk of devaluing the currency, which is why we’ve put a limit on the maximum number of tokens.</p>
<h2 id="the-ambassadors-idea-is-good-are-they-volunteers-or-are-the-compensated">The ambassadors idea is good. Are they volunteers or are the compensated?</h2>
<p>Ambassadors - are people that share our mission and vision. They participate as volunteers.  Some of them are working on their own start-ups that will mesh well with our network, while allowing them to operate as independent businesses.</p>
<h2 id="security-can-facial-recognition-be-hacked">Security: can facial recognition be hacked?</h2>
<p>We are technology providers and we use only innovative solutions. Modern bio-authentication technologies allow to identify user with 99.9% probability. Having said that, it would be foolish to say that something cannot be hacked.  We’re taking very strong precautions, and security is part of our development model, not an afterthought.</p>
<p>In the event that some vulnerability is found, we’ll do what every other fintech company does, which is to patch it and prevent it from happening again.  Also, just because something can be hacked does not mean it will.  Most of our users will have the equivalent of $50 or less in their accounts, which does not make them high-value targets for hackers.</p>
<p>It’s not worth exposing yourself to investigation and discovery to steal $50, and they’d need to hack each user individually, because the actual database of user verification info is stored in the Ethereum blockchain, which is considerably more difficult to hack than spoofing facial recognition software for one person.</p></div>
