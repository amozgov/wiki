# Humaniq - a new generation mobile bank

Humaniq is a simple and secure 4th generation mobile bank. We are developing a completely new banking experience by dissolving all the barriers of archaic banks such as the need to come to a branch, doing endless paperwork, dealing with hard-to-use, buggy mobile apps, and protecting data with hard-to-remember, complex passwords.
We have created a safe, strong financial tool, specifically designed to be used by people who are undereducated or who don’t possess identification. Most of them live in emerging economies on less than two dollars a day. We believe we can change that. Learn more about Humaniq…

## Why we do what we do

- **2 billion people**
This staggering sum represents the "unbanked”; people around the world without access to bank accounts. That lack of access is especially a problem for the poor, for women, and for people in rural areas.

- **Blockchain & Bio ID**
Blockchain  + Bio ID Blockchain technologies are revolutionizing our world, but along with the adoption of digital assets come new usability challenges and a need for both identity and security options. Biometric authentication is the key.

- **Startup Swarm**
We will open source our protocol to third party developers to create new solutions for our end users. That will also create utility for our currency, the HMQ, by providing a token that has true fungible value.

**We have created Humaniq to implement two big ideas: to open access to modern financial services for 2 billion unbanked people, and to allow vetted partners to participate in building ‘win-win’ products and services for the Humaniq community that can provide revenue and services for all the stakeholders.

If this interests you, **help us make Humaniq a reality** - anyone can contribute and we need everyone at any skill level to participate.

- **Community Management**  
Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system - without community Humaniq is meaningless. We're looking to create a positive, fun environment to explore new ideas, experiment and grow the Humaniq community. Building a community takes a lot of work, but the people you'll meet and long lasting relationships you'll form makes it all worthwhile.

## The Roadmap

Here is our current roadmap [image], note that the version numbers in this roadmap might not correlate with features as we are switching to a 'rolling release' cycle much like the Linux kernel, instead of feature based releases.
